# P17

P17 is a simple Svelte library for crafting forms. I crafted it to demonstrate my understanding and ability in accessible HTML form design and development.

> I haven't really tested the accessibility aspect yet.

I used the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) as a loose guide because it helps to have a starting point; empirically backed double so.

My library's unique selling point is that the field unvalidates when a user focuses on an input after validation has accepted or reject the current content (JavaScript only). It's not perfect. The unvalidation simply removes the error message which means users won't have it as reference as they're typing a new answer.

> Maybe I'll improve that in a future version. No garuntees.

## Made to be Plundered

This library is made to be forked or plundered by anyone for whatever you want as long as you adhere to the permissive MIT license. If you think you can make it twice as good fork the repo and do it; steal snippets or concepts; copy the whole thing and modify to complete a two week job in two days then sit back and play games until hand in. Whatever, just break the rules and innovate!
