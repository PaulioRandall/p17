# P17

P17 is a simple Svelte library for crafting forms. Crafted to demonstrate my understanding and ability in accessible HTML form design and development.

> I haven't really tested the accessibility aspect yet.

I used the [GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) as a loose guide because it helps to have a starting point; empirically backed double so.

My library's unique selling point is that the field unvalidates when a user focuses on an input after validation has accepted or reject the current content (JavaScript only). It's not perfect. The unvalidation simply removes the error message which means users won't have it as reference as they're typing a new answer.

> Maybe I'll improve that in a future version. No garuntees.
